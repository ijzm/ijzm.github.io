Nitrome Unoficial FAQ:

**GAMES:** 

What happened to Flightless?
> With flightless incase nobody realised what happened. 
> We made a demo to put onto steam. It went into steam green light to get voted up onto steam. 
> It sat there for months getting love but not enough to get it greenlit onto the platform. So we took that as a sign we should move on. 
> A while after doing so steam decided to change the rules and allow a lower entry bar to greenlight making 100’s of games overnight get the go ahead. 
> But by then our teams had moved onto other projects. I think even the artist had moved countries to another job as he hated living in london.

**MUSIC:**

Why can't we buy/stream Nitrome Music?
> Yeah sorry, there just is a very small vocal minority of fans that care about the music enough to download. We took that it was worth perusing but it really is just too time consuming for what its worth. sorry
